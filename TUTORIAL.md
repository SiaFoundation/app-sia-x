## Introduction

This is a guide on how to use the Sia app on a Ledger Nano device.  The Sia app currently supports the Ledger Stax, Nano S, Nano SP, and Nano X models and supports transactions involving Siacoins and Siafunds.

## Requirements

    - Initialized Ledger device with the latest firmware
    - Ledger device connected to computer via USB
    - Ledger Live open

## Enable Developer Mode
The Sia app for Ledger devices can only be installed in developer mode.  To enable developer mode, do the following:

1. Open the **Settings** tab in Ledger Live
2. Select the **Experimental Features** tab within settings
3. Enable the option titled **Developer Mode**

## Install the Sia App

1. Select the **Manager** tab in Ledger Live
2. Ensure you are on the **Apps Catalog** tab within the manager
3. If prompted, allow the Ledger Manager access to your device
4. Search for Sia within the app catalog
5. Click install and wait for processing to complete
6. Exit Ledger Live

## Connecting to Sia Wallet

1. Connect and unlock your Ledger device
2. Ensure that Ledger Live does not have the manager open.  Leaving it open will interfere with the Sia web wallet and cause the Sia app to crash.
3. Open the Sia app on the device
4. Visit the [Sia Central Wallet website](https://wallet.siacentral.com/)
5. When we first visit the Sia Central Wallet, we are prompted to set a password to encrypt the wallet(s) with.  Make sure to select a secure password.
6. After typing and confirming the password, select **Ledger Wallet** as the type of wallet.
7. Press the connect button and select your Ledger device
8. Select **Import Public Key** and accept the public key request on your device
9. Press done to confirm wallet importation
